## Abstract
Forests are a critical component of our world’s
 health, but it is still difficult today to see them properly over large
 distances. This research proposes a real-world and intelligent
 solution using satellite images and DL to detect forest stands
 with greater accuracy. Aiming to achieve faster and more scalable
 forest analysis than traditional field surveys, this study develops
 an automated land cover identification system using the EuroSAT
 dataset. The primary objective of this research was to train
 and compare the YOLOv8-nano model in order to analyze its
 performance in detecting forests and other land covers. The
 model was validated using 27,000 images across 10 different
 classes in order to provide extensive exposure to a variety of
 data. It showed robust performance with a peak accuracy of
 97.5%. These results emphasize the high capabilities of the
 model for real-time forest observation and wise environmental
 decision making. In general, this research is an important step
 towards using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery to
 enhance conservation, as well as to more effectively manage forest
 resources at different locations.
